Lithium mailer is a plugin for sending email messages from your li3 application.

### Mailers

Delivering an email message involves multiple components. To provide convenient ways to manage emails the plugin
introduces the concept of mailers, whose duty is to create and send messages. For this purpose the plugin implements
a base [ Mailer](li3_mailer/action/Mailer) class which can be subclassed to create mailers with specific options, but also can be used for delivery.

When subclassing the `Mailer` the `$_messages` property may be used to set configuration for every message, or specific
messages like:

{{{
class MyMailer extends \li3_mailer\action\Mailer {
	protected static $_messages = array(
		array('cc' => array('Me' => 'my@address')),
		'specific' => array('cc' => array('other@address'))
	);
}

// the message will be cc'd to my@address
MyMailer::deliver('test');

// the message will be cc'd both to my@address and other@address
MyMailer::deliver('specific');

// the base class also may be used
use li3_mailer\action\Mailer;
Mailer::deliver('message');
}}}

Several options may be configured for creating (like `'from'`, `'to'`, etc.), rendering (like `'data'`, `'layout'`, etc.) and
delivering (like `'delivery'`, adapter specific transport options, etc.) the message.

### Delivery

Sending an email message is done with the delivery service, which can be configured to handle multiple configurations.
The configuration may hold options for creating a message (like `'from'`, `'to'`, etc.):

{{{
use li3_mailer\action\Mailer;
use li3_mailer\net\mail\Deliver;
Delivery::config(array(
    'first' => array('adapter' => 'Simple', 'from' => 'first@address'),
    'second' => array('adapter' => 'Simple', 'from' => 'second@address')
));

// send from first@address
Mailer::deliver('test', array('delivery' => 'first'));

// send from second@address
Mailer::deliver('test', array('delivery' => 'second'));
}}}

As with other `Adaptable`-based configurations, each delivery configuration is defined by a name,
and an array of options for creating the transport adapter. The [ Delivery](li3_mailer/net/mail/Delivery)
also supports environment-based configuration like:

{{{
use li3_mailer\net\mail\Deliver;
Delivery::config(array('default' => array(
    'production' => array('adapter' => 'Simple'),
    'development' => array('adapter' => 'Swift')
)));
}}}

#### Built-in transport adapters

 - [ **Simple**](li3_mailer/net/mail/transport/adapter/Simple): sends email messages with `PHP`'s built-in function `mail`.
 - [ **Swift**](li3_mailer/net/mail/transport/adapter/Swift): depends on the [ SwiftMailer](http://swiftmailer.org/) library for sending email messages.
 - [ **Mailgun**](li3_mailer/net/mail/transport/adapter/Mailgun): uses the [ Mailgun](http://www.mailgun.com/) hosted service to send email messages (depends on cURL).
 - [ **Debug**](li3_mailer/net/mail/transport/adapter/Debug): instead of sending email messages it logs them to a given file or directory.

### Messages

A [ message](li3_mailer/net/mail/Message) object holds all the related information that is needed for rendering and sending. The `Mailer` can be used to
construct such a message, get a suitable adapter and pass the message to the adapter for delivery. As the examples from earlier have shown there are a
couple places, where the information stored in the message can be customized, in increasing precedence:

 - in delivery config
 - in mailer's `$_messages[0]`
 - in mailer's `$_messages['message_name']`
 - explicit options (e.g. `$options` arguments for `Mailer::deliver()`)

A message has one special attribute, the `$baseURL` property. It is easier to conceive the purpose of this value with understanding
where it is needed and how it is used:

 - When creating embedded attachments (see later) for example the message may need to generate a Content-ID. For generating this
   unique id the [ RFC](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2822) recommends the form `timestamp@host`.
 - When generated URLs in templates (see later) should be absolute with scheme.

Furthermore as sending emails from cron scripts is a common use-case the plugin can not depend on having a web environment, where
such a value can be determined. For this purpose the message has this property, which can be configured as seen already (e.g. in the
delivery, the mailer or explicit). To generate correct URLs the `$baseURL` should have the format `scheme://host/base` (e.g.
`http://example.com/my/app`). In addition when the message is initialized it will try to autodetect this setting (so it is possible to
not specify this option when sending email messages only from web environment).

#### Attachments

A [ message](li3_mailer/net/mail/Message) may have attachments. A simple example with attaching 2 pdf files to the message:
{{{
    $attach = array('file1.pdf', '/path/to/file2.pdf');
    Mailer::deliver('my_message', compact('attach'));
}}}

The attachment paths may be relative to mail asset path (`app/mails/_assets` by default, determined with `Media`, see later). Apart from
regular files, attaching remote files (if `allow_url_fopen` is enabled) and explicit content are also possible:
{{{
    // attach a remote file
    $attach = array('http://example.host/file.pdf');
    Mailer::deliver('my_message', compact('attach'));

    // attach simple content with filename
    $attach = array(array(
        'data' => 'this is my content',
        'filename' => 'cool.txt'
    ));
    Mailer::deliver('my_message', compact('attach'));

    // attach image data with content type
    $img_data = create_custom_image(...);
    $attach = array(array(
        'data' => $img_data,
        'filename' => 'cool.png',
        'content-type' => 'image/png'
    ));
    Mailer::deliver('my_message', compact('attach'));
}}}

### Templates

Rendering email messsages is similar to rendering responses with a few exceptions. The most important is that instead of having a request
which can be negotiated to infer the most suitable (single) type for response the email message may have multiple types (and does not have a
'corresponding' request). To support this the plugin implements a mail [ Media](li3_mailer/net/mail/Media) class simlar to http's [ Media](li3_mailer/net/http/Media),
which can be used to register new types or configure the built-ins.

The default base path for email templates is `/app/mails` (instead of `/app/views`) to better separate from view templates, however this can be
configured with the [ Media](li3_mailer/net/mail/Media) class. The exact template will be determined by the message's name and the mailer by default,
so a command like `Mailer::deliver('test')` would use `/app/mails/test.html.php` for rendering html content, while `FooMailer::deliver('test')` would
first look for `/app/mails/foo/test.html.php` and fallback to the former only if the latter can not be found. Similarly the former command
would use the `/app/mails/test.text.php` template for rendering text (plain) content. The default base paths for layouts and elements are
`/app/mails/layouts' and `/app/mails/elements` respectively.

As with rendering from a controller these defaults may be overriden when sending mail messages:
{{{
    // renders /app/mails/test.{:type}.php with default layout (/app/mails/layouts/default.{:type}.php)
    Mailer::deliver('test');

    // renders /app/mails/other.{:type}.php with default layout
    Mailer::deliver('test', array('template' => 'other'));

    // renders /app/mails/test.text.php without layout, only text (plain) type
    Mailer::deliver('test', array('types' => 'text', 'layout' => false));
}}}

#### Helpers and handlers

The plugin provides similar helpers for mail templates like `lithium` provides for views: the
[ Html](li3_mailer\template\helper\mail\Html) and [ Form](li3_mailer\template\helper\mail\Form) helpers.
They provide the same functionality as the view helpers.

The `Html` helper's [ image](li3_mailer\template\helper\mail\Html::image()) method may be used to embed images:
{{{
    <p>My image: <?= $this->image('my/image.png'); ?></p>
}}}
This will place an <img /> element into the message with its source attribute set to the `Content-ID` that belongs to the attachment.

Creating or replacing a mail template helper is done exactly like regular view helpers with the exception that
mail helpers are namespaced as `helper\mail\Name` (e.g. should be placed in `app/extensions/helper/mail/Name.php`).

Handlers are very similar to helpers and there is two commonly used handler that behaves a bit different
in mail templates compared to view templates:

 - The `url` handler will generate absolute URLs by default.
 - The `path` handler will generate absolute URLs by default and `'cid:ID'` style values for embeds.

#### Referencing the message

In the template context `$this` refers to the `Renderer` object, which exposes the message, so it is
possible to add or change the subject, add header(s) or attach files:
{{{
    <?php $this->message()->subject('My subject); ?>
    <?php $this->message()->header('Custom', 'header'); ?>
    <?php $this->message()->attach('file.pdf'); ?>
}}}

Please note that when the message has multiple types, these methods should be placed in only one template,
as calling them multiple times will lead to unexpected behavior: for example while the last value will override
the formers when calling `subject` (rendering order is determined by the message's type order), attaching the
same file from multiple templates will result in multiple attachments of the same file.
